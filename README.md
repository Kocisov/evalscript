# EvalScript
> Funny language that replaces JavaScript things with Eval

Why? Because, why not `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Installation
**Install EvalScript globally from npm**

```bash
npm install -g evalscript

# also old version of evalscript is available
npm install -g evalscript@old [evalold instead of eval2 command]
# you should really not use that! :D
```

## Usage
If you already installed EvalScript, now you can use **eval2** command in your command line

```bash
eval2 filename
# eval2 ./test/test.es
```

File you want to compile **must have .es extension!**
